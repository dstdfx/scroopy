The implementation is based on ["Writing An Interpreter In Go"](https://interpreterbook.com/) by Thorsten Ball.

### Supports

* Basic math expressions: `+`, `-`, `/`, `*`
* Basic binary expressions: `>`, `<`, `==`, `!=`
* Variable bindings
* Conditionals
* Functions
* Build-in functions
* Higher-order functions
* Closures

### Using REPL (read-eval-print loop)

Build the REPL's binary:
```bash
make build
```
